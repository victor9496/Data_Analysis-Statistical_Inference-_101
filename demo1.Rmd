This demo is broken into three parts: the first part reviews the formulas
you've learned for unbiased estimators of the population mean and variance by
putting them into practice with Question 35 of Chapter 7. 

The second part introduces simulation studies by simulating the sampling 
distribution of the mean. At that section's conclusion, we will reproduce 
Figure 7.2 from the book, which shows simulated histograms for the sampling 
distribution of the mean with a few different sample sizes. 
We'll review the properties of sampling distributions briefly. 

Finally, we'll put this all together with Question 65 from Chapter 7. This
question asks us to compute unbiased estimates of the mean and variance, as 
well as simulate a sampling distribution for the mean. As a result, this
question ties the concepts from the first two parts together. In this section,
there is little explanatory text: mostly the solution code is presented, so
it can serve as a review for you. 

### Estimating population mean and variance: Question 35
A simple random sample of a population of size 2000 yields the following
25 values:
```{r}
x <- c(104, 86, 91, 104, 79, 
  109, 80, 103, 98, 87,
  111, 119, 99, 98, 94,
  109, 88, 108, 83, 92,
  87, 122, 96, 107, 97)

n <- length(x)  # sample size
N <- 2000       # population size
```

**Calculate an unbiased estimate of the population mean.**
```{r}
x_bar <- mean(x)
```

**Calculate an unbiased estimate of the population variance and $Var(\bar{X})$.**
```{r}
# unbiased estimate of the population variance
s2 = sum( (x - x_bar)^2 / (n-1) )

# unbiased estimate of variance of sample mean
# see Section 7.3 Corollary A 
var_xbar <- s2/n * (1 - n/N)
```

**Give approximate 95% confidence intervals for the population mean and total.**
```{r}
z <- abs(qnorm((1 - 0.95)/2))     # find 2.5th percentile of normal dist
                                  # took abs value bc normal dist is symmetric

# 95% confidence interval is x_bar +/- z*sqrt(var_xbar)
x_bar + c(-1, 1)*z*sqrt(var_xbar)
```

**How could we use the var() function in the computations above?**

We did the computations above manually to demonstrate how to use the equations
presented in the text. However, R has a built-in function for computing
variance of a sample as well, ```var()```. Let's look at the help file
to examine what it does. 

```{r}
?var
```

If we look at the 5th paragraph in the *Details* section, we will see:

> The denominator n - 1 is used which gives an unbiased estimator 
> of the (co)variance for i.i.d. observations. These functions 
> return NA when there is only one observation (whereas S-PLUS 
> has been returning NaN), and fail if x has > length zero.

This tells us that the ```var()``` function is using n-1 as a denominator 
when computing variance, rather than n. We can check this ourselves.
Let's go back to the estimate of variance we computed previously, ```s2```.
We used the denominator ```n-1```. If the ```var()``` function is doing what
it's saying it's doing, then the value of ```s2``` should match up with
```var(x)```.

```{r}
# print s2 again, for reference
s2

# compute using R's var function:
var(x)
```

## Introduction to simulation
### Simulating the sampling distribution of the mean
Herksen (1976) published data on the number of patients discharged from 393
short-stay hospitals during January 1968. 

Suppose we want to find the sampling distribution of the mean for a sample of
size 16 from the population of 393 hospitals. 

To find this distribution analytically, we would form all (393 choose 16) 
samples and compute the mean of each one. But (393 choose 16) evaluates to 
```r choose(393, 16)```...that's over $10^25$ possible samples, which is
totally impractical. 

Instead, we can try estimating the sampling distribution through *simulation*. 
We will draw many samples of size 16, compute the mean, and then form a histogram
of these means. We won't get all $>10^25$ possible samples, but we'll hopefully
get a few thousand (or more, depending on what you have time for), and have
a sense for what the shape of the distribution would look like. 

First, we'll read in the hospital data:
```{r}
# read in the hospital data
hospitals <- read.csv("hospitals.csv", header = TRUE)
names(hospitals) <- c("discharges", "beds")   # fix the names of the columns

# check that there are 393 hospitals:
nrow(hospitals)
```

Let's try taking a single sample from the hospital discharge data. 
The ```sample()``` function in R can do this for us.
```{r}
sample(hospitals$discharges, size = 16, replace = FALSE)
```

You can see that if you repeat this a few times, you'll get a
different set of 16 numbers each time. This is like drawing 16 numbers from
a box with 393 tickets, over and over again. 

R makes it easy for us to take repeated samples with the ```replicate()``` 
function. This function evaluates an expression a certain number of times,
and saves the result in a matrix or list format. Below, we are telling
R to repeat sampling 10 times. Observe the result:

```{r}
sim_samples_16 <- replicate(n = 10, 
          expr = sample(hospitals$discharges, size = 16, replace = FALSE))

sim_samples_16
```

You should see that the result is a 16 x 10 matrix, one column for each sample. 

Recall that the original goal was to be able to simulate the sampling distribution
of the mean for a sample of size 16. So far, we've demonstrated how to draw 
multiple samples of size 16. What's left is to compute the mean of each sample.
We can do this easily using the function ```colMeans()``` or ```rowMeans()```,
which calculate the mean of each column or row, respectively. Here, since
each column represents a sample, we will use ```colMeans()```.

```{r}
colMeans(sim_samples_16)
```

Great! We've found the means for 10 samples of size 16.

We've done essentially what we need to do to simulate the sampling distribution
of the mean. However, simulations usually require much more replication for the
histogram to begin to take shape (think: a histogram with 10 values is a lot
less precise or refined than a histogram with 500 values). 

Per Example A in Section in 7.3.1, we will take 500 samples 
(this number is chosen arbitrarily---the bigger the better), 
compute the mean for each of the 500 samples, and plot a histogram. This next
code chunk consolidates the work from the previous chunks.

Note that we are overwriting the variable ```sim_samples_16.```

```{r}
# produce 500 samples of size 16 from the hospitals discharge data
sim_samples_16 <- replicate(n = 500, 
                    sample(hospitals$discharges, size = 16,
                           replace = FALSE))

# compute the mean of each sample
sim_means_16 <- colMeans(sim_samples_16)


# produce a histogram
hist(sim_means_16, 
     xlab = "Sample Mean",
     ylab = "Counts",
     main = "Histogram of Sample Means, n = 16", 
     xlim = c(200, 1800),
     breaks = seq(200, 1800, 100),    # set bin endpoints to 200, 300, 400,...
     axes = FALSE)

# create custom x-axis, to match the example in the text:
axis(2) # default y-axis
axis(1, at = seq(200, 1800, 200)) # set axis tick marks at 200, 400, 600,...
```

### Reproducing Figure 7.2 (more advanced R coding)
Figure 7.2 from the book is displayed below. As you can see, it shows simulated 
histograms for four different sample sizes: n = 8, 16, 32, and 64. 
We've just created a histogram for n = 16. Creating a histogram for the other
sample sizes is no different; all of the computations are the same.

One addition is that you've learned from class that $\bar{X}$ is an unbiased
estimate for the true mean. The true mean, here, is the mean of all 393
hospital discharge values, ```r mean(hospitals$discharges)```. We'll add a
reference line for this population mean, so you can see how the sample means
are distributed relative to the "true" value. 

!["Figure 7.2"](Figure7pt2.png)

We can simply produce the other three histograms by writing an R function that
performs all of the computations above, but allows us to input the sample size
we'd like for it to use.

Note: Writing an R function is an advanced technique which you aren't expected 
to know how to do, but if you've had some exposure to programming (e.g., you've 
taken Stat 133 or some CS classes), this will be familiar to you.

You could just have easily copied and pasted the previous code chunk 
four separate times, switching out the sample size for what you want, 
but that's bad practice: if you can write a function so you aren't 
copying and pasting commands repeatedly, you should do it.
However, writing R functions is beyond the scope of the course. If you're
new to R, just look at this section of the demo as something cool to look
forward to learning if you decide to take your skills further!

```{r}
# define function to produce 500 samples of size n, compute the mean, 
# and plot the histogram using bin width bin_width
```{r, include = FALSE}
SimulateSamplingDist <- function(n, bin_width){
  # produce 500 samples of size 16 from the hospitals discharge data
  sim_samples_16 <- replicate(n = 500, 
                              sample(hospitals$discharges, size = n,
                                     replace = FALSE))
  
  # compute the mean of each sample
  sim_means_16 <- colMeans(sim_samples_16)
  
  
  # produce a histogram
  hist(sim_means_16, 
       xlab = "Sample Mean",
       ylab = "Counts",
       main = paste("Histogram of Sample Means, n =", n),
       xlim = c(200, 1800),
       breaks = seq(200, 1800, bin_width),    # set bin endpoints
       axes = FALSE)
  
  # create custom x-axis, to match the example in the text:
  axis(2)
  axis(1, at = seq(200, 1800, 200))
  
  abline(v = mean(hospitals$discharges), col = "red")
  }  
```

Now we'll reproduce Figure 7.2 from Example A in Section 7.3.1.
```{r, fig.height=12, fig.width=4}
par(mfrow=c(4, 1)) # figure is drawn as a 4 x 1 array 

SimulateSamplingDist(n = 8, bin_width = 100)
SimulateSamplingDist(n = 16, bin_width = 100)
SimulateSamplingDist(n = 32, bin_width = 50)
SimulateSamplingDist(n = 64, bin_width = 50)
```

There are three features of this set of plots that are noteworthy. 

1. *All of the histograms are centered about the population mean.* Recall the 
result from the book, which states that $\bar{X}$ is approximately normally 
distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2/n$. 

2. *As the sample size increases, the histograms become less spread out.* 
This makes sense, because $Var(\bar{X}) = \sigma^2/n$, so it is inversely
proportional to $n$. 

3. The histogram of the 393 hospital discharges is show below. This represents
a histogram of the "population." Note that *the histogram of the population 
is neither normally distributed, nor symmetric around its mean.* 
But the sampling distributions are! It is not necessary for the population to
be normally distributed or symmetric about the mean in order for the sampling
distributions to be.

```{r}
hist(hospitals$discharges, 
     main = "Histogram of hospital discharges",
     xlab = "Hospital discharges",
     ylab = "Count")

# add reference line for population mean
abline(v = mean(hospitals$discharges), col = "red")
```


## Putting it all together: Question 65
All of the work we've done above gave us the tools to do parts a through e of
Question 65. This is a review of the previous two sections (Question 35 and
simulation); as a result, I've put less comments and explanatory text for the
solutions below. 

The disk file ```cancer``` contains values for breast cancer mortality from
1950 to 1960 (y) and the adult white female population in 1960 (x) for 301 
counties in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. 

**Make a histogram of the population values for cancer mortality.**
```{r}
# read in the data
cancer <- read.csv("cancer.csv", header = FALSE)
# first column contains mortality from breast cancer, 
# second column contains the total female population in the county
names(cancer) <- c("mort", "fem_pop")

# check there are 301 counties
N <- nrow(cancer)
N

# produce a histogram
hist(cancer$mort,
     main = "Breast Cancer Mortality",
     xlab = "Mortality")
```

**What are the population mean and total cancer mortality? What are the 
population variance and standard deviation?**
```{r}
# calculate population mean
mu <- mean(cancer$mort)
mu

# total cancer mortality:
N*mu

# population variance and standard deviation
sigma2 <- var(cancer$mort)*(N-1)/N 
sigma2

sigma <- sqrt(sigma2)
sigma
```

**Simulate the sampling distribution of the mean of a sample of 25 observations 
of cancer mortality.**
```{r}
# we'll simulate 1000 samples of size 25 from the mortality data
sim_cancer_samples <- replicate(n = 1000,
                          sample(cancer$mort, size = 25))

# compute means
sim_cancer_means <- colMeans(sim_cancer_samples)

# plot histogram
hist(sim_cancer_means,
     main = "Histogram of sample means",
     ylab = "Count",
     xlab = "Sample means")
abline(v = mu, col = "red") # Add reference line for population mean
```


**Draw a simple random sample of size 25 and use it to estimate the mean and 
total cancer mortality.**
```{r}
sample_cancer <- sample(cancer$mort, size = 25)

# estimate of population mean
mean(sample_cancer)

# estimate of total cancer mortality
mean(sample_cancer)*N
```


**Estimate the population variance and standard deviation from the sample 
of part (d).**
```{r}
# estimate of the population variance
var(sample_cancer)

# estimate of the population standard deviation
sd(sample_cancer) 

# or equivalently: 
sqrt(var(sample_cancer))
```
